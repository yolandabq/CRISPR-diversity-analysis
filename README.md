# CRISPR-diversity-analysis
Custom analysis scripts used in my master's thesis: "Retrospective analysis of the allelic diversity observed after the use of CRISPR tools"

The repository contains the custom scripts used to analyze data from CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. 
Two datasets were used: 
1. The data of 1656 real human genome locations made available by Ryan T. Leenay et al. The data is available in the next link: 
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Analyzed_T-Cell_DNA_Repair_Outcomes/6957125?file=12860147. In the file "Leenay_crispr_set_list.rds". 
2. Data collected from experiments performed in the laboratory of Dr. Lluis Montoliu. 

The "Shell" folder contains the scripts to download, pre-process and prepare the data.
The "R" folder contains the scripts to perform the analysis with CrispRVariants and the necessary statistical analyzes.
The "Python" folder contains the scritps to analyze diverse characteristics of the data.
