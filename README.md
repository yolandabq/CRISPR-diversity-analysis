# CRISPR-diversity-analysis
Custom analysis scripts used in my master's thesis: "Retrospective analysis of the allelic diversity observed after the use of CRISPR tools"

The repository contains the custom scripts used to analyze data from CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. 
Two datasets were used: 
1. The data of 1656 real human genome locations made available by Ryan T. Leenay et al. The data is available in the next link: 
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Analyzed_T-Cell_DNA_Repair_Outcomes/6957125?file=12860147. In the file "Leenay_crispr_set_list.rds". 
2. Data collected from experiments performed in the laboratory of Dr. Lluis Montoliu.
